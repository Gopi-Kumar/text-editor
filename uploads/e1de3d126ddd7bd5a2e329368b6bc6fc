***** Relation between x and x - 1 
	->if x- 1 is even 
	then 
			x & x - 1 =  x-1, 
			x | x - 1 = x,  
			x ^ x - 1 = 1

	->if x is the exponential of 2
	then
			x & x - 1 = 0
			x | x - 1 = x + (x - 1)
			x ^ x - 1 = x + (x - 1)


***** Relation between x and x^2
	
		x & x^2 = 0;
		x | x^2 = x + x^2
		x ^ x^2 = x + x^2
















//Computer Networks

There are two possible types of connections: 

Point-to-Point Connection
Multipoint Connection

Spatial Sharing: If several devices can share the link simultaneously, its
		 called Spatially shared line configuration. 

Temporal (Time) Sharing: If users must take turns using the link , then its
		 called Temporally shared or Time Shared Line configuration. 

A transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver 
i.e it is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another. Transmission 
Media is broadly classified into the following types: 

Guided Media(Wire transmission media)
	->Twisted Pair Cable
		->Unshielded Twisted Pair(UTP)
			Advantages: 
				⇢ Least expensive
				⇢ Easy to install
				⇢ High-speed capacity
				⇢ Susceptible to external interference
				⇢ Lower capacity and performance in comparison to STP
				⇢ Short distance transmission due to attenuation
		->Shielded Twisted Pair(STP)
			Advantages: 
				⇢ Better performance at a higher data rate in comparison to UTP
				⇢ Eliminates crosstalk
				⇢ Comparatively faster
				⇢ Comparatively difficult to install and manufacture
				⇢ More expensive
				⇢ Bulky
	->Coaxial Cable
		Advantages: 
			High Bandwidth
			Better noise Immunity
			Easy to install and expand
			Inexpensive
	->Optical Fibre Cable
		Advantages:  
			Increased capacity and bandwidth
			Lightweight
			Less signal attenuation
			Immunity to electromagnetic interference
			Resistance to corrosive materials
		Disadvantages:  
			Difficult to install and maintain
			High cost
			Fragile
	->Stripline cable
	->Microstripline cable
Unguided Media(Wireless Or Unbounded transmission media)
 Features:  
	The signal is broadcasted through air
	Less Secure
	Used for larger distances
There are 3 types of Signals transmitted through unguided media: 
(i)Radiowaves
(ii)Microwaves
(iii) Infrared
